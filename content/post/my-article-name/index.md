## Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder caused by the deaths of neurons in parts of the brain. It is incurable. Early medical intervention can, however, prolong survival. That makes prompt diagnosis desirable.<br>
帕金森病是一种逐渐形成的神经系统疾病，由大脑部分神经元的死亡引起。它是无法治愈的。然而，早期的医学干预可以延长患者的生存期。这使得及时诊断成为可取的做法。<br>

Unfortunately, the initial signs of Parkin
son's vary from person to person and there is no specific test at this early stage which can reliably distinguish it from other brain illnesses.<br>
不幸的是，帕金森病的初始症状因人而异，在早期阶段还没有专门的测试能可靠地将它与其他脑部疾病区分开来。<br>
